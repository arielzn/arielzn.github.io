I'm a physics phD who uses linux everyday at work and home since 10 years.
When in front of a computer I spent most of the time looking at the terminal rather than anything else. 

As a passionate linux fan I love to experiment with different toys (raspberries pis, cloud machines...). 
This makes me stumble upon different issues to solve/setup.
I like to document every steps of what I do, to avoid spending google time or trial and error again for that magic onliner or the setup of a personal VPN.


That's how this personal webspace started.
